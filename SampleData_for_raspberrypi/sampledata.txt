Astronaut Koichi Wakata arrived at the International Space Station on Oct. 6 to begin his fifth space mission, a new record for a Japanese astronaut, after a U.S. SpaceX spacecraft successfully docked with the orbiting lab.
Wakata is one of four astronauts on a NASA mission to the ISS for a six-month stay to conduct science experiments. They arrived around 29 hours after the launch of the U.S. commercial spacecraft Crew Dragon from Florida on Oct. 5.
The 59-year-old, who is also the oldest Japanese astronaut to reach the ISS, said it had been Åga smooth ride, just like in the simulation,Åh and thanked the international organizations behind the mission. ÅgI cannot wait to start working with our crewmates,Åh he added.
With an eye to future missions on the moon and Mars, experiments aboard the space station will include testing the movement of liquids in low-gravity environments, which it is hoped will lead to the development of technologies such as lubricants for use by space explorers.
The other members of the latest SpaceX Crew-5 mission are two NASA astronauts ? spacecraft commander Nicole Mann and pilot Josh Cassada ? as well as Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina. Wakata and Kikina are serving as mission specialists. (Kyodo)
